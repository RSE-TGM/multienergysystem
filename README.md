# MultiEnergySystem - MES
Modelica Library for modelling, simulation &amp; control of District Heating Systems and Natural Gas Systems.

## Overview

**MultiEnergySystem** is a comprehensive library designed for the study and analysis of the interactions between different energy domains, including thermal, gas, and electric systems. This library provides essential models for systems such as district heating networks and gas distribution networks, and includes capabilities for modeling specific fluids like real gases. Whether you are a researcher, engineer, or hobbyist, **MultiEnergySystem** offers the tools and models necessary to understand the operation and control of multi-energy systems.

## Features

- **District Heating Networks**: Models of various thermohydraulic components such as water pumps, boiler, heat exchangers, etc., aimed at studying traditional and modern DHNs.
- **Gas Distribution Networks**: Models for the study of hydrogen blending in gas distribution networks.
- **Modeling of real gases**: It includes two equations for modeling real gases: Papay and Peng-Robinson.
- **Multi-Energy System integration**
- **Experimental Facility for MES analysis**

### Contributors

**MultiEnergySystem** was mainly developed by Marcelo Andre Muro Alvarado ([@marcelo-muro](https://github.com/marcelo-muro)) and Guido Sassaroli ([@guidosassaroli](https://github.com/guidosassaroli)) at Ricerca sul Sistema Energetico RSE S.p.A., with the technical support of several colleagues of our research department. We hope this library proves to be a valuable resource for your multi-energy system studies and applications.
